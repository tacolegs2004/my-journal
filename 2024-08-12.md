Hello, everyone. This is my personal journal that I am managing using Markdown.
This is mostly a test just for fun. I don't know how often or if I'll continue
to update this but we'll see. This is my first entry. I am using Neovim to write
this. (Here is my config.)[https://github.com/tacolegs2004/neovimconfig]
