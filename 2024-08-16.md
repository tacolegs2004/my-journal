Hi there. It is currently 12:47am on Friday, August 16, 2024. I know I haven't wrote
much within the last few days. I just kinda forgot about this tbh. I am starting to
get into React Query, a very interesting state management library which makes 
data-fetching much more streamlined. It seems a bit simpler compared to
fetching data in a `useEffect`.
